# Templates

This folder contains sample templates to customize madonctl output.

I'd like to eventually have support for themes with collections of templates.

Here's an example using a template with ANSI color escape codes (for UNIX/Linux):

    madonctl timeline --limit 2 --template-file ansi-status.tmpl

Feel free to contribute if you have nice templates of if you want to work on themes as well!
